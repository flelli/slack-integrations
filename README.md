# Summary
Here are some scripts and utilities I'm using to integrate [Slack](https://slack.com/) with other apps and services.
Use them freely.

* [nagios](nagios) contains scripts used for [Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/)

# Set up
## Set up the Slack Webhook
In order to receive notifications you need an active Slack team and know which channel you will send the notifications to. You may wish to set up a new channel for notifications.
For general instructions about Slack incoming webhooks just jump to [this page](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks).

Then you're ready to set up your webhook by following these simple steps:
1. open the [Incoming Webhook](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/) custom integration page for your team
2. in the *Post to Channel* box select the default channel you want notifications to be sent to (or create a new channel in place). You will be able to override the target channel when using the script to send notifications
3. in the next page take note of the **Webhook URL** that was generated and optionally set other fields like the webhook label, name, icon etc. The URL looks like `https://hooks.slack.com/services/ABCDEFGHI/FGHIJKLMN/123abc456def789ldt645Bgs`. In the **Customize Name** field you can set the username you want notifications to appear from. For example you may set `nagios` or `zabbix`

Now you're ready to go on the Slack side and you can start sending notifications.
